  <p>Savvy financial executive and business consultant with a strong balance of real estate, finance, technology, and operational acumen. A
    business consulting background has provided financial insight into multiple types of businesses and projects which, along with a
    thorough understanding of operational processes and entrepreneurial flexibility, can be applied to multiple business units. With an
    aptitude for creative solutions and teamwork, I believe I could integrate quickly into any collaborative culture.</p>
